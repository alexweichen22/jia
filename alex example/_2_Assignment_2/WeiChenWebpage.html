				<header><h2 id="ambitions">Ambitions</h2></header>
				<p>
					Like many people, my ambitions are to realize all my own dreams. 
					Luckily, I made a lot of realistic dreams, therefore my dreams 
					realization are much like tasks planning and completion other than pure daydreaming.
					This makes it possible for me to realize my dreams one by one.
					<br />
					<br />
					My dreams that have been realized include: immigrating to a country of my own choice,
					marrying a woman I love, having lovely kids, buying a house with a swimming pool, 
					entering a career generally in Electronics & Computer Science.
					<br />
					<br />
					My present ambition is to switch my career to my favorite choice: software development.
					And furthermore, my ambition is to succeed in this dream career, and make wealth
					out of my skills, most likely through starting my own business at some future time point.
					Probablly, I will be able to make the business bigger, and pass down to my kids...
					<br />
					<br />
					Dream is not something that can be stopped, working hard to make them come true ...

				<p>
					I mainly talk about my career interest hereby. I am interested in chanllege and self improvement, 
					especially in the domain that can fully utlize my knowledge, experience and potential.
					Being specific, programming is my biggest career interest from many years ago. 
					Limited by my home country's rigid education system,
					I was not able to get into Programming career through education. Pursuing this career took me a
					long detour, through immigrating to Canada and all what I suffered in this long detour.
					<br>
					<br>
					After so many years slowing moving my career closer and closer to programming 
					(from Mechanical Engineering, to Telecom, to Automation, to Network, and eventually to IPD), when
					the real jumpping-over chance came, I had no hesitation at all. Go for it, IPD and my programming career.
