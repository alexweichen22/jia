				Greece has a <strong>Mediterranean climate</strong> with plenty of sunshine, mild temperatures and a
				limited amount of
				rainfall.
			</p>
			<p>
				Due to the country's geographical position, its rugged relief and its distribution between the mainland
				and the sea, there is great variation in Greece's climate.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>In summer</strong>, the dry hot days are cooled by seasonal winds called the meltemi, while
				mountainous regions
				have generally lower temperatures.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>The winters</strong> are mild in lowland areas, with a minimum amount of snow and ice, yet,
				mountains are usually
				snow-covered. Moreover, a common phenomenon is the occurrence of different climactic conditions during
				the same season (for instance, mild heat in coastal areas and cool temperatures in mountainous regions).

				Little is known to date to the <strong>Paleolithic Era</strong> in Greece, but quite a lot is known
				about the <strong>Neolithic
					Period</strong> that followed (approx. 7th – 4th Millennium B.C.) and its civilisation, which is
				traced mainly in
				areas that included Thessaly and Macedonia. Civilisations with impressive achievements developed during
				the Bronze Age (approx. 3000 – 1150 B.C.) in the <a
					href="http://www.visitgreece.gr/en/greek_islands/northeastern_aegean_islands"
					target="_blank">Northeastern Aegean</a>, the <a
					href="http://www.visitgreece.gr/en/greek_islands/cyclades" target="_blank">Cyclades</a> (its
				trademark being
				the large-sized marble figurines), Crete and the Greek Mainland. The civilisations that flourished
				during the 2nd Millennium in the two regions, known as the <strong>Minoan</strong> and the
				<strong>Mycenean</strong> Periods respectively,
				are considered to be the first of the great civilisations in Greece.
			</p>
			<p>
				Architectural remains (e.g. palaces), as well as pottery work, stone carving (vessels, sealstones),
				metallurgy (vessels, weapons), jewelry making and paintings (murals) were impressive and representative
				works of these civilisations.
			</p>
			<p>
				During the historical years, the civilisations of the <strong>Geometric Period</strong> (9th – 8th
				Century B.C.) and the
				<strong>Archaic Period</strong> (7th – 6th Century B.C.) were considered to be the forerunners of the
				culture found in
				the <strong>Classical Period</strong> (5th – 4th Century B.C.). The <strong>Classical works of
					art</strong>, with their ideal proportions
				and beauty, expressed the philosophical ideals of their times, and were the model of the European
				Renaissance Era of the 15th Century A.D. Greek civilisation developed during the subsequent
				<strong>Hellenistic
					Years</strong> (3rd – 1st Century B.C.) and the <strong>Roman Years</strong> (1st Century B.C. – 3rd
				Century A.D.), within the
				framework of large kingdoms and an empire respectively.
			</p>
			<p>
				Greek civilisation again flourished -within the framework of an empire- during the <strong>Byzantine
					Years</strong>
				(early, middle and late - 4th – 15th Century A.D.), while civilisation in more recent times was marked
				by the Ottoman occupation and the emergence of the new Hellenic State after the Greek War of
				Independence (1821-1830).

				There is a direct link between religion as a cultural phenomenon and tourism. Religion in terms of
				tourism is based on a clear cultural bedrock of tradition. Greeks and foreign visitors are stunned by
				Greece’s majestic <a href="http://www.visitgreece.gr/en/religion/churches" target="_blank">churches</a>
				of the Byzantine era, countless rural churches and metochia (monastery
				grounds and gardens), sacred places of pilgrimage and religious sites, all of which inspire awe. Whether
				they are here for religious purposes or purely for pleasure, visitors to <a
					href="http://www.visitgreece.gr/en/main_cities" target="_blank">mainland</a> Greece and its islands
				are amazed by the countless number of sites of religious devotion and major references to the divine.
				Visitors have the chance to see buildings and <a
					href="http://www.visitgreece.gr/en/religion/religious_sites" target="_blank">religious sites</a>
				related to various dogmas and religions,
				which all co-exist in a state of ongoing dialogue and thus highlight the rare historic and cultural
				mosaic of Greece.
			</p>
			<p>
				Some of Greece’s most important religious centres include the monastic community of <strong>Mount
					Athos</strong>, the
				impressive monasteries of <a href="http://www.visitgreece.gr/en/culture/easter_at_meteora">Meteora</a>
				the <strong>Cave of the Apocalypse</strong> and the <a
					href="http://www.visitgreece.gr/en/culture/world_heritage_sites/aghios_ioannis_theologos_monastery"
					target="_blank">Monastery of Saint John Theologos</a>
				on Patmos, the places where the <a
					href="http://www.visitgreece.gr/en/religion/on_the_path_of_apostle_paul" target="_blank">Apostle
					Paul</a> preached, and the pilgrim destinations of the <a
					href="http://www.visitgreece.gr/en/religion/churches/panayia_of_tinos" target="_blank">Madonna
					(Panayia) of Tinos</a>, <a href="http://www.visitgreece.gr/en/religion/panayia_soumela"
